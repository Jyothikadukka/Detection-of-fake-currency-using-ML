<h1>Fake Currency Detection System using CNN & MobileNet</h1>

This project is a deep learning-based application that helps identify counterfeit currency notes.
It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and MobileNet for classification, integrated with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy use. The system also includes user authentication to ensure secure access.<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
Deep Learning Model: Built using CNN and MobileNet for accurate detection.
User Authentication: Login/Signup system for secure access.
GUI Application: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter/PyQt.
Image Processing: Detects whether an uploaded currency note is real or fake.
Lightweight & Fast: MobileNet ensures efficiency on normal PCs.<br>
<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
Python (core programming)
TensorFlow / Keras (for CNN & MobileNet)
OpenCV (for image processing)
Tkinter / PyQt (for GUI)
SQLite / File-based auth (for user authentication)<br>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
User logs in through the authentication system.
Uploads or scans a currency note image.
Model processes the image using CNN + MobileNet.
Output displayed as Real or Fake currency note.<br>
<h2>Applications</h2>
Banking sector
Retail shops
ATMs & cash counters
Personal use for validation
